This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue: unexpected style overrides due to specificity problems. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `solution.css` offers a corrected version.  The issue arises from conflicting selectors, and understanding CSS specificity is key to resolving it. Solutions include adjusting selector specificity, using more precise selectors, and avoiding unnecessary use of `!important`.
